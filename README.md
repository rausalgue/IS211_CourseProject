#IS211 Final Project

Checkout the Application to Manage your Books

The application is meant for users needing to manage books and search for books.

With the cloud system, add any number of clouds to categorize your book needs.

The Search page will allow you to search for Books in the Book Database. With the ISBM number, search any book in the
google API.

Once your result is found, click on the name to view information and add to any of your clouds

If you are not a beta Tester, simply create a new account with our Sign Up process from the main page.


FOR ADMINS:

There are two admin users with the application

U: admin
P: password

U: system
P: password

Model:

The application uses four different tables:
users
clouds
books
items

The items table contains an Identifier that links a Cloud to the book.
The cloud in turn contains an identifier that links it to the owner of the cloud.

To grow our database, everytime we select a search result, the application adds it to our database.

To add a new Book to our database, simply select the action button in the search results table.
